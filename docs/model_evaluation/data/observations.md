# Observational Data on Gadi

NCI not only hosts numerous datasets for climate research, it also manages and optimises curated data collections. Data collections allow for easier access and use of the numerous datasets created by different organisations, optimising evaluation where numerous datasets are used.

ACCESS-NRI has a curated data collection for Climate Model Evaluation in NCI project [*ct11*](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/ct11/join). This _ACCESS-NRI Replicated Datasets for Climate Model Evaluation_ provides observational datasets in a format that can be ingested by evaluation frameworks ACCESS-NRI supports. More information and updates can be found in this [post](https://forum.access-hive.org.au/t/official-release-of-the-access-nri-replicated-datasets-for-climate-model-evaluation-nci-data-collection/1661).

<!-- In particular, we want to highlight the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phases 6 and 5 that are hosted by NCI as a sponsor of the [Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)](https://esgf.nci.org.au/projects/esgf-nci/). The ESGF are federated data centres across the globe that enable access to the largest archive of climate data world-wide. This portal allows you to find, select and download data files from the federation. -->
